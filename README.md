# Runedoku Helper
A Runelite plugin to provide hints and utilities to help solve Runedoku puzzles.

## Features
* Overlay numbers instead of runes - makes it easier to proceed methodically, as well as easier to use an external 
  sudoku solver
* Pencil markings - mark the currently selected rune as a possibility with the right-click menu or shift-click.
  (Only displays as a number - recommended to use with the number overlay)
* Highlights clashing entries - mistakes are easier to find with an error border around clashing entries
* Configurable - all colors and features are fully configurable in the plugin's config panel

## Unavailable Features
This plugin does not and will not provide automatic solutions shown in-client.  While it is probably not against the
game rules to do so, the sudoku solving speed this would facilitate would significantly increase the risk of your
account being incorrectly tagged as a bot.  Due to the longstanding history of bots solving Runedoku to buy runes to
sell at a profit on the GE, this is a real concern, and I do not wish to risk being the cause of anyone being banned.
